Tomboy Reborn
=============

What is this?
-------------

This project intends to provide a "drop-in", straightforward replacement of deprecated , but extremely usefull, /Gnome Tomboy/

This effort came after reviewing existing efforts (tomboy-ng, QOwnNotes, ..), but all lacking the basic features of legacy Tomboy : Simplicity, security and network synchronisation.

This is a fork from tomboy-ng, after obvious mis-alignement of users need and software objectives with tomboy-ng author.
